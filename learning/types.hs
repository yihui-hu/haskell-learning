-- :t (==)
-- (==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
--
-- The => symbol is a class constraint. The above is read as
-- such: the equality function takes any two values that are of the
-- same type and returns a Bool, and the type of the two vals
-- must be a member of the Eq class.

-- :t fst
-- fst :: (a, b) -> a

-- :t (==)
-- (==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
